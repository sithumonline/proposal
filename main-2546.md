## 0.1 Abstract

Vast majority of individuals utilize social media, and these platforms have become integral components of modern lifestyles. Those social networks use centralized servers to store user data.

This centralized approach has many disadvantages. This research project aims to develop a decentralized social network that utilizes the user's device as storage, while ensuring that data remains secure and authentic, with full control over user data residing with the user. 

The implementation of a user data decentralization protocol, along with the design and deployment of a client application capable of seamless communication with other network peers via the decentralized protocol, are central components of this research project.

## 1.0 INTRODUCTION

<!-- Common intro -->

At present, the vast majority of individuals utilize social media, and these platforms have become integral components of modern lifestyles. Social networks have established a global presence, with the initial recognizable social network, "Six Degrees," being launched in 1997, enabling users to establish profiles and connect with other users. Today, there are numerous social networks, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter, and others, and their usage continues to grow [1]. These social networks are becoming popular among people due to their purpose and differences which made them competitive with each other.
It is imperative to examine the reasons for the increased usage of social networks. The most prevalent reason is that users desire to stay connected with others and remain updated on global events. With hectic schedules and workloads, physical interaction with others is often impractical, leading people to connect virtually, which proves more feasible. Additionally, social media is used for sharing photos and videos for entertainment and expressing opinions and ideas. Moreover, social media platforms serve as a means of researching products to purchase, prompting businesses to concentrate on online marketing and target audience acquisition. However, centralization of these social networks has led to various problems, which have recently become hot topics.

According to [2], MIT Sloan professor Sinan Aral said “Social media is rewiring the central nervous system of humanity in real time” at the Social Media Summit @ MIT which brought professionals together to explore these challenges and focus on solutions, which ranged from new oversight committees to breaking up major corporations. And also, it mentions major concerns in present social media networks. The spread of false news and misinformation, the difficult balance between user privacy and platform transparency, lack of regulation for social media companies are some of the areas that has affected through social media at present.

With the emergence of web 3.0 in 2014[3], people are inclined towards seeking solutions to the issues associated with web 2.0 technologies within the web 3.0 technology stack. As a result, decentralization has become a prominent factor. Decentralized culture has been established, primarily due to the evolution of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin.

As mentioned in [4], the growth trajectory of Web 3.0 is expected to persist, as individuals progressively recognize the advantages it offers in contrast to conventional social media websites. While searching for the most suitable web3 social media platforms, it is advisable to consider a range of factors such as traditional social media platforms, social media users, decentralized social networks, internet freedom, free speech, online networks, among other relevant considerations.
According to [5,] Mastodon[6] and DeSo[7] are two of the most prominent decentralized social networking platforms currently under development. The fundamental goal of these social networks is to confront and overcome the issues connected with modern social media platforms by yielding the monopolistic control exerted by leading social media corporations and instead conceding power to the platform's actual users.
Despite the proliferation of decentralized social media platforms presently, certain limitations and challenges still require attention. A majority of these platforms employ blockchain technology to achieve decentralization, which, as highlighted in [8], can result in higher costs in terms of processing speed.

The main objective of this research endeavor is to construct a decentralized social network that utilizes the user's device as storage, while ensuring that data remains secure and authentic, with full control over user data residing with the user. The implementation of a user data decentralization protocol, along with the design and deployment of a client application capable of seamless communication with other network peers via the decentralized protocol, are central components of this research project.

<!-- Common intro -->

Traditional approach of software development is to develop a software application and deploy it on a single machine. This approach is not suitable for modern applications. Modern applications are distributed in nature. They are deployed on multiple machines. These applications are called distributed applications. Distributed applications are very complex in nature. They are very difficult to develop and maintain. There are many challenges in developing and maintaining distributed applications. These challenges are related to communication between two applications, data consistency, data availability, data security, etc. 

Communication between two application is the base of any distributed applications. Distributed applications have mainly two types of architecture. One is client-server architecture and other is peer-to-peer architecture. In client-server architecture, one application is the client and other is the server. Client application sends request to the server and server application responds to the client. In peer-to-peer architecture, both the applications are peers. They communicate with each other directly. Peer has same functionality as any other peer. There is no central authority in peer-to-peer architecture.

Modern client-server architecture is based on RESTful web services. RESTful web services are based on HTTP protocol. HTTP protocol is stateless. It means that the server does not remember the previous request. It is the responsibility of the client to maintain the state of the request. Other than HTTP protocol, there are other protocols like gRPC, SOAP, etc. which are used for communication between two applications.

In peer-to-peer architecture, there are few protocols which are used for communication between two applications, example: torrent protocol, etc.
Most of them are specialized for a particular purpose therefore they are not used in general purpose applications and those protocols are very old and not maintained.

This research component mainly focuses on develop a new reusable protocol for communication between two peer-to-peer application which is based on TCP/IP protocol. 

## 1.1.	Background and Literature

Successful projects in past: 
- Skype
- Gnutella 
- Kazaa
- eMule 
- Torrent 

are have following problems:

- Lack of good documentation or none at all
- Restrictive licensing or no license to be found
- Old with the last update more than a decade away
- No easy to reach point of contact
- Closed source (product) or the source doesn't exist anymore
- No specification
- Implementation doesn’t expose a friendly API
- Tightly coupled with a specific use

### 1.1.1.	Skype

[Link](https://eprints.um.edu.my/4797/) Skype is a proprietary peer-to-peer Internet telephony service that allows users to communicate with others via the Internet using voice calls, video calls, and instant messaging. It use a centralized server which helps the system sign up new users as well as authenticates existing users with user ID and password information. Super node is peer with higher bandwidth and CPU power. It is used to improve scalability. Those super nodes do the heavy lifting for the Skype service, and it considered as a disadvantage as the service relies on these super nodes, not a centralized server.

According to the Wikipedia [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype):

- Initial release : August 29, 2003
- Latest release : 20 January 2023
- License : Proprietary

### 1.1.2.	Gnutella

[Link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242320308_Deliverable_D61_ARGUGRID_Platform_Design) Guentella is a peer-to-peer file sharing network. Nodes on the network can be either clients or servers. Gnutella use TCP/IP stack for communication. Four types of messages are used in the Gnutella protocol. Ping, Pong, Query and Query Hit.

Flooding is used to propagate messages. Each message has a Time To Live (TTL) field. When TTL reaches zero, the message is dropped. Drawback of flooding is that it floods the network with a vast amount of messages. It does not scale well.

According to the last stable specification [Link](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse522/05au/gnutella_protocol_0.4.pdf), last update was on 2001.

### 1.1.3.	Kazaa

[Link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242320308_Deliverable_D61_ARGUGRID_Platform_Design) Kazaa is a peer-to-peer file sharing application for music, video and other digital media files.
FastTrack is underlying protocol of Kazaa. FastTrack also uses the super node concept.

Kazaa has same problem as Skype, as it relies on a super node.

According to the Wikipedia [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazaa):

- Initial release : March 1, 2001
- Latest release : 3.2.7 / 26 November 2006
- License : Proprietary

![Kazaa network architecture](./img/kazaa.png)
### 1.1.4.	eMule

[Link](http://pages.di.unipi.it/ricci/e-mule-report.pdf) eMule is a peer-to-peer file sharing application. It is based on the eDonkey2000 network. eMule uses a hybrid network architecture. It uses a centralized server for indexing and a decentralized network for file sharing.

### 1.1.5.	Torrent

[Link](https://stuker.com/wp-content/uploads/import/i-1fd3ae7c5502dfddfe8b2c7acdefaa5e-bittorrentecon.pdf)
BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer file sharing protocol. It is used to distribute data and electronic files over the Internet. It is one of the most common protocols for transferring large files, such as digital video files containing TV shows or video clips or digital audio files containing songs.
When a user downloads a file using the BitTorrent protocol, the user becomes a seeder after the download is complete. The user can then upload the file to other users, thus becoming a leecher. With that, file can have multiple seeders and leechers at the same time.

However, BitTorrent protocol is specifically designed for file sharing therefor it is not suitable for general purpose communication.

## 1.2.	Research Gap

Main goal of this research component is to develop a new reusable peer-to-peer communication protocol that is suitable for general purpose communication.

Most of the existing peer-to-peer protocols are designed for specific purpose, such as file sharing, and they are not suitable for general purpose communication.

Skype is proprietary [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype) and it relies on a super node [Link](https://eprints.um.edu.my/4797/). Therefore, it is not suitable for general purpose communication and super node makes it centralized.

Gnutella has open specification [Link](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse522/05au/gnutella_protocol_0.4.pdf), and it has problems such as flooding [Link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242320308_Deliverable_D61_ARGUGRID_Platform_Design) and TTL and it no longer maintained.

Like Gnutella, Torrent is also open source, but it is specifically designed for file sharing and it is not suitable for general purpose communication.

Kazaa [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazaa) and eMule [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMule) are not no longer maintained.

Even though much research has been done and applications have been developed, non of them are suitable for general purpose communication.
Develope reusable, open source, decentralized, peer-to-peer communication protocol is the main goal of this research component.

## 2.0	Research Problems

After decades of protocol development, the Internet is still plagued by a number of fundamental problems. Most of protocols are designed for client server architecture, and they are not suitable for peer-to-peer architecture.
