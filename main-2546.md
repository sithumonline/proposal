## 1.0 INTRODUCTION

_INTO ABOUT OVERALL RESEARCH_

Traditional approach of software development is to develop a software application and deploy it on a single machine. This approach is not suitable for modern applications. Modern applications are distributed in nature. They are deployed on multiple machines. These applications are called distributed applications. Distributed applications are very complex in nature. They are very difficult to develop and maintain. There are many challenges in developing and maintaining distributed applications. These challenges are related to communication between two applications, data consistency, data availability, data security, etc. 

Communication between two application is the base of any distributed applications. Distributed applications have mainly two types of architecture. One is client-server architecture and other is peer-to-peer architecture. In client-server architecture, one application is the client and other is the server. Client application sends request to the server and server application responds to the client. In peer-to-peer architecture, both the applications are peers. They communicate with each other directly. Peer has same functionality as any other peer. There is no central authority in peer-to-peer architecture.

Modern client-server architecture is based on RESTful web services. RESTful web services are based on HTTP protocol. HTTP protocol is stateless. It means that the server does not remember the previous request. It is the responsibility of the client to maintain the state of the request. Other than HTTP protocol, there are other protocols like gRPC, SOAP, etc. which are used for communication between two applications.

In peer-to-peer architecture, there are few protocols which are used for communication between two applications, example: torrent protocol, etc.
Most of them are specialized for a particular purpose therefore they are not used in general purpose applications and those protocols are very old and not maintained.

This research component mainly focuses on develop a new reusable protocol for communication between two peer-to-peer application which is based on TCP/IP protocol. 

## 1.1.	Background and Literature

Successful projects in past: 
- skype
- gnutella,
- Kazaa
- eMule 
-torrent 

are have following problems:

- Lack of good documentation or none at all
- Restrictive licensing or no license to be found
- Old with the last update more than a decade away
- No easy to reach point of contact
- Closed source (product) or the source doesn't exist anymore
- No specification
- Implementation doesnâ€™t expose a friendly API
- Tightly coupled with a specific use

### 1.1.1.	Skype

According to the paper, Skype architecture is not a very precise peer-to-peer network as long as it uses a centralized server which
helps the system sign up new users as well as authenticates existing users with user ID and password information; Skype use super nodes to improve scalability. These super nodes do
the heavy lifting for the Skype service, and the service
relies on these super nodes, not a centralized server, for considered as a disadvantage.

### 1.1.2.	Gnutella

According to the paper, Gnutella is a pure decentralised P2P system where each participating node can either act as a server or as a client, called servents. It uses IP as the underlying network and the communication between the peers is performed by the use of an application protocol that supports four types of messages, namely Ping, Pong, Query and Query Hit.

The Ping and Query messages are propagated using a flooding technique while query reply messages are sent back to the query initiator following the reverse path. Flooding has proved to be a costly operation since it inundates the network with a vast amount of messages, and as a consequence the approach does not scale well. To limit the amount of messages propagated, each message header contains a Time To Live (TTL) field and each time it reaches zero, the message is dropped.

According to the last stable specification [Link](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse522/05au/gnutella_protocol_0.4.pdf), last update was on 2001.

### 1.1.3.	Kazaa

According to the paper, Kazaa belongs to the second generation peer-to-peer systems and is partially centralised system based on the FastTrack peer-to-peer protocol. FastTrack uses the notion of supernodes to improve scalability. [Link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242320308_Deliverable_D61_ARGUGRID_Platform_Design) 

Kazaa has same problem as Skype, as it relies on a super node.

According to the Wikipedia [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazaa):

- Initial release : March 1, 2001
- Latest release : 3.2.7 / 26 November 2006
- License : Proprietary

### 1.1.4.	eMule

According to the paper, The eMule network is populated with several hundreds of eMule servers and millions of eMule
clients. Clients should connect one server for getting network services, the server connection stays open as long as the client is in the system. The servers are performing centralized
indexing services (like in Napster) and do not communicate with other servers. [Link](http://pages.di.unipi.it/ricci/e-mule-report.pdf)

### 1.1.5.	Torrent

According to the paper, With BitTorrent, when multiple people are downloading the same
file at the same time, they upload pieces of the file
to each other. This redistributes the cost of upload
to downloaders, (where it is often not even metered),
thus making hosting a file with a potentially unlimited number of downloaders affordable.

BitTorrent protocol is specifically designed for file sharing therefor it is not suitable for general purpose communication.
