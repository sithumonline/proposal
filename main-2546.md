## 1.0 INTRODUCTION

_INTO ABOUT OVERALL RESEARCH_

Traditional approach of software development is to develop a software application and deploy it on a single machine. This approach is not suitable for modern applications. Modern applications are distributed in nature. They are deployed on multiple machines. These applications are called distributed applications. Distributed applications are very complex in nature. They are very difficult to develop and maintain. There are many challenges in developing and maintaining distributed applications. These challenges are related to communication between two applications, data consistency, data availability, data security, etc. 

Communication between two application is the base of any distributed applications. Distributed applications have mainly two types of architecture. One is client-server architecture and other is peer-to-peer architecture. In client-server architecture, one application is the client and other is the server. Client application sends request to the server and server application responds to the client. In peer-to-peer architecture, both the applications are peers. They communicate with each other directly. Peer has same functionality as any other peer. There is no central authority in peer-to-peer architecture.

Modern client-server architecture is based on RESTful web services. RESTful web services are based on HTTP protocol. HTTP protocol is stateless. It means that the server does not remember the previous request. It is the responsibility of the client to maintain the state of the request. Other than HTTP protocol, there are other protocols like gRPC, SOAP, etc. which are used for communication between two applications.

In peer-to-peer architecture, there are few protocols which are used for communication between two applications, example: torrent protocol, etc.
Most of them are specialized for a particular purpose therefore they are not used in general purpose applications and those protocols are very old and not maintained.

This research component mainly focuses on develop a new reusable protocol for communication between two peer-to-peer application which is based on TCP/IP protocol. 

## 1.1.	Background and Literature

Successful projects in past: 
- skype
- gnutella,
- Kazaa
- eMule 
-torrent 

are have following problems:

- Lack of good documentation or none at all
- Restrictive licensing or no license to be found
- Old with the last update more than a decade away
- No easy to reach point of contact
- Closed source (product) or the source doesn't exist anymore
- No specification
- Implementation doesnâ€™t expose a friendly API
- Tightly coupled with a specific use

### 1.1.1.	Skype

[Link](https://eprints.um.edu.my/4797/) Skype is a proprietary peer-to-peer Internet telephony service that allows users to communicate with others via the Internet using voice calls, video calls, and instant messaging. It use a centralized server which helps the system sign up new users as well as authenticates existing users with user ID and password information. Super node is peer with higher bandwidth and CPU power. It is used to improve scalability. Those super nodes do the heavy lifting for the Skype service, and it considered as a disadvantage as the service relies on these super nodes, not a centralized server.

According to the Wikipedia [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype):

- Initial release : August 29, 2003
- Latest release : 20 January 2023
- License : Proprietary

### 1.1.2.	Gnutella

[Link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242320308_Deliverable_D61_ARGUGRID_Platform_Design) Guentella is a peer-to-peer file sharing network. Nodes on the network can be either clients or servers. Gnutella use TCP/IP stack for communication. Four types of messages are used in the Gnutella protocol. Ping, Pong, Query and Query Hit.

Flooding is used to propagate messages. Each message has a Time To Live (TTL) field. When TTL reaches zero, the message is dropped. Drawback of flooding is that it floods the network with a vast amount of messages. It does not scale well.

According to the last stable specification [Link](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse522/05au/gnutella_protocol_0.4.pdf), last update was on 2001.

### 1.1.3.	Kazaa

[Link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242320308_Deliverable_D61_ARGUGRID_Platform_Design) Kazaa is a peer-to-peer file sharing application for music, video and other digital media files.
FastTrack is underlying protocol of Kazaa. FastTrack also uses the super node concept.

Kazaa has same problem as Skype, as it relies on a super node.

According to the Wikipedia [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazaa):

- Initial release : March 1, 2001
- Latest release : 3.2.7 / 26 November 2006
- License : Proprietary

### 1.1.4.	eMule

[Link](http://pages.di.unipi.it/ricci/e-mule-report.pdf) eMule is a peer-to-peer file sharing application. It is based on the eDonkey2000 network. eMule uses a hybrid network architecture. It uses a centralized server for indexing and a decentralized network for file sharing.

### 1.1.5.	Torrent

[Link](https://stuker.com/wp-content/uploads/import/i-1fd3ae7c5502dfddfe8b2c7acdefaa5e-bittorrentecon.pdf)
BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer file sharing protocol. It is used to distribute data and electronic files over the Internet. It is one of the most common protocols for transferring large files, such as digital video files containing TV shows or video clips or digital audio files containing songs.
When a user downloads a file using the BitTorrent protocol, the user becomes a seeder after the download is complete. The user can then upload the file to other users, thus becoming a leecher. With that, file can have multiple seeders and leechers at the same time.

However, BitTorrent protocol is specifically designed for file sharing therefor it is not suitable for general purpose communication.

## 1.2.	Research Gap

Main goal of this research component is to develop a new peer-to-peer 
communication reusable protocol that is suitable for general purpose communication.

Most of the existing peer-to-peer protocols are designed for specific purpose, such as file sharing, and they are not suitable for general purpose communication and some of them are not open source.

Gnutella is the only open source peer-to-peer protocol that is suitable for general purpose communication, but it has some problems such as flooding and TTL and it no longer maintained.

Like Gnutella, Torrent is also open source, but it is designed for file sharing and it is not suitable for general purpose communication.

Kazaa and eMule are not open source and no longer maintained.

## 2.0	Research Problems

After decades of protocol development, the Internet is still plagued by a number of fundamental problems. Most of protocols are designed for client server architecture, and they are not suitable for peer-to-peer architecture. Most of the existing peer-to-peer protocols are designed for specific purpose, such as file sharing, and they are not suitable for general purpose communication. Some of them are not open source and no longer maintained.

In this research identified the following problems of the existing peer-to-peer protocols:

- Design for specific purpose
- Not open source
- No longer maintained
- Not suitable for general purpose communication
