## 1.0 INTRODUCTION

Traditional approach of software development is to develop a software application and deploy it on a single machine. This approach is not suitable for modern applications. Modern applications are distributed in nature. They are deployed on multiple machines. These applications are called distributed applications. Distributed applications are very complex in nature. They are very difficult to develop and maintain. There are many challenges in developing and maintaining distributed applications. These challenges are related to communication between two applications, data consistency, data availability, data security, etc. 

Communication between two application is the base of any distributed applications. Distributed applications have mainly two types of architecture. One is client-server architecture and other is peer-to-peer architecture. In client-server architecture, one application is the client and other is the server. Client application sends request to the server and server application responds to the client. In peer-to-peer architecture, both the applications are peers. They communicate with each other directly. Peer has same functionality as any other peer. There is no central authority in peer-to-peer architecture.

Modern client-server architecture is based on RESTful web services. RESTful web services are based on HTTP protocol. HTTP protocol is stateless. It means that the server does not remember the previous request. It is the responsibility of the client to maintain the state of the request. Other than HTTP protocol, there are other protocols like gRPC, SOAP, etc. which are used for communication between two applications.

In peer-to-peer architecture, there are few protocols which are used for communication between two applications, example: torrent protocol, etc.
Most of them are specialized for a particular purpose therefore they are not used in general purpose applications and those protocols are very old and not maintained.

This research component mainly focuses on develop a new reusable protocol for communication between two peer-to-peer application which is based on TCP/IP protocol. 

## 1.1.	Background and Literature

Old successful peer-to-peer applications like skype, gnutella,
Kazaa, eMule and torrent are not maintained and they are not suitable for modern applications.

### 1.1.1.	Skype

Skype is a peer-to-peer application which is used for communication between two users. It is developed by Microsoft. It is a proprietary protocol. It is not open source. It is not maintained. It is not suitable for modern applications. [Link](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Skype-architecture-Porter-2006_fig6_233815225)

## 1.2.	Research Gap

Main goal of this research component is to develop a new reusable protocol for communication between two peer-to-peer application which is based on TCP/IP protocol. This protocol will be open source and it will be maintained. It will be suitable for modern applications.

Build a new protocol for general purpose communication between two peer-to-peer applications. This protocol will be open source and it will be maintained. It will be suitable for modern applications.
